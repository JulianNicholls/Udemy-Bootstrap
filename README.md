# Udemy Bootstrap Development

[Udemy Profession Development by building 10 projects](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/)

There are no files from the rest of the course because I abandoned it after 3 or 4 sections. It consisted of the trainer cutting and pasting sections from the Bootstrap website with little extra explanation.

I learnt more about Bootstrap from one small section in this course: https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course than I did in the time I wasted in the Bootstrap one.
