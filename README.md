# Udemy Bootstrap Development

[Udemy Bootstrap Development by building 10 projects](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/)

## Not a good course
There are no files from the rest of the course because I abandoned it after
3 or 4 sections.  It consisted of the trainer cutting and pasting sections 
from the Bootstrap website with little extra explanation.

## Here's a better one
I learnt more about Bootstrap from one small section in this course: 
[Complete Web Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course-2)
than I did in the time I wasted in this Bootstrap one.
